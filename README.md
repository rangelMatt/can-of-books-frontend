# Can Of Books

**Authors**: Jeffrey Jenkins and Matt Rangel
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Collaboration

### Logistical

What hours will you be available to communicate?

* 1:30 - 6:30
* Late hours 7:30 - 9:00

What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

* Slack/Remo

How often will you take breaks?

* Every hour.

What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

* Work with TA’s and Instructional team to get what we need
* follow the 15 min rule

### Cooperative

Make a list of each parson’s strengths.

* Jeffrey
  * Innovation
  * High Quality Work
  * Quick Learner
* Matt
  * Great communicator
  * Project management
  * Keeping momentum

How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?

* Pick up on the material quickly, not having to pull up a TA every instance.
* Be able to have a great plan and able to execute on the right foot.
* In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
* Cement the concepts of code and to speak it appropriately
* Confidence in time management and non technical skills
* Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
* Pair programming and explaining what we are doing to each other.
* This will help each other learn by one having to slow down to communicate the code and the other to catch up to learn those concepts.

### Conflict Resolution

* What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
* Communicate and level with the other person.
* Both will be able to check in with each other on mini plans
* What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
* With the thought that the above failed; escalate it.

### How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

* Make time to explain our understanding of something and do what we can to shore up each others skills.
